Cupid is a debugging shim for Love2d.

Features:

* Developer console, displays print messages and executes lua.
* Game error detection and recovery.
* Can render a physics debug layer.
* Reload game sourcecode on the fly.


Installing
----------

* Copy the `cupid.lua` file to your project directory.
* Create a `conf.lua` file if you don't already have one.
* Add `require("cupid")` to the top of your `conf.lua`.


Use
---

While your game is running, press tilde ( ~ ) to activate the
console.  Print commands will show here.  Type `reload` to 
reload your game.

Automatic Reloading
-------------------

By default cupid listens for console commands on UDP port 10137.
This command works well:

`watchmedo-2.7 shell-command --command='echo reload | nc -u localhost 10173' .`
